/home/codespace/.gradle/caches/8.13/transforms/63eea69683be1464c2e4775f2cb7ee93/transformed/jetified-runtime-release/jars/lint.jar: Warning: Library lint checks reference invalid APIs; these checks will be skipped!

Lint found an issue registry (androidx.compose.runtime.lint.RuntimeIssueRegistry)
which contains some references to invalid API:
org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.session.KtAnalysisSessionProvider: org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.lifetime.KtLifetimeTokenFactory getTokenFactory()
(Referenced from androidx/compose/runtime/lint/AutoboxingStateCreationDetector.class)

Therefore, this lint check library is not included
in analysis. This affects the following lint checks:
AutoboxingStateValueProperty
AutoboxingStateCreation
CoroutineCreationDuringComposition
FlowOperatorInvokedInComposition
ComposableLambdaParameterNaming
ComposableLambdaParameterPosition
ComposableNaming
StateFlowValueCalledInComposition
CompositionLocalNaming
MutableCollectionMutableState
ProduceStateDoesNotAssignValue
RememberReturnType
OpaqueUnitKey
UnrememberedMutableState

To use this lint check, upgrade to a more recent version
of the library. [ObsoleteLintCustomCheck]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteLintCustomCheck":
   Lint can be extended with "custom checks": additional checks implemented by
   developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages
   required by a library or a company coding style guideline.

   The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a
   performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.

   This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete
   APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.

   It may also flag issues found to be using a newer version of the API,
   meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or
   Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.

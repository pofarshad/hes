# Add project specific ProGuard rules here for this library module.
# These rules are applied only to this module and are not passed to consumers.
# For a pure Kotlin domain module with interfaces and data classes,
# ProGuard rules are often not needed unless reflection or specific
# annotations that require keeping are used.

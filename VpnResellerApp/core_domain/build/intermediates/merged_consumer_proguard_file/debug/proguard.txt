# Add any ProGuard rules here that should be automatically applied to

# If your domain module defines public interfaces or data classes that

# Example:
# -keep interface com.yourcompany.vpnresellerapp.core_domain.repository.MyRepository { *; }
# -keep class com.yourcompany.vpnresellerapp.core_domain.model.MyDomainModel

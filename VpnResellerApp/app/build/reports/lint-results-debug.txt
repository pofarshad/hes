   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteLintCustomCheck":
   Lint can be extended with "custom checks": additional checks implemented by
   developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages
   required by a library or a company coding style guideline.

   The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a
   performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.

   This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete
   APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.

   It may also flag issues found to be using a newer version of the API,
   meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or
   Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/workspaces/hes/VpnResellerApp/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

/workspaces/hes/VpnResellerApp/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: The image ic_launcher_round.png varies significantly in its density-independent (dip) size across the various density versions: mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 64x64 dp (96x96 px), mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 96x96 dp (96x96 px), mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 48x48 dp (96x96 px), mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 32x32 dp (96x96 px), mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 24x24 dp (96x96 px) [IconDipSize]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDipSize":
   Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute
   to roughly the same density-independent pixel (dip) size. This catches
   errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are
   changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.

/workspaces/hes/VpnResellerApp/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: The following unrelated icon files have identical contents: ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png, ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png, ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png, ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png, ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png [IconDuplicates]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicates":
   If an icon is repeated under different names, you can consolidate and just
   use one of the icons and delete the others to make your application
   smaller. However, duplicated icons usually are not intentional and can
   sometimes point to icons that were accidentally overwritten or accidentally
   not updated.
